# Introduction

The main goal of this project is to do an overview of the different approaches to backend development in Python. I guess I'll have to add a database and a nicer looking frontend as I go along, and eventually  have the examples converge to be the same application, but since I'm just starting this now, we'll see where it goes :) I think this will be a great learning experience for me, and if anyone wants to join in, you're welcome :)
